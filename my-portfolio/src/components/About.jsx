          <p>
            My name is MarzeeQ Williams and coding is one of my hobbies. My
            interest in coding started through a game called Minecraft. The game
            has features that allow you to bring your imagination to life, but
            the features in the game are limited.
          </p>

          <p>
            Learning to code allowed me to make Minecraft mods that give me the
            most flexibility with what I'm trying to do. Most of my coding
            interests started with game development and AI, but my career goals
            are in web development and design. I see game dev and AI as more of
            a hobby rather than a career, and my strengths lie more with HTML,
            CSS and JavaScript which is perfect for web development.
          </p>

          <p>
            AI fascinates me because of its capabilities. Although I don't fully
            understand how it works, the little research I did got me hooked.
            Just the idea of a program that can detect patterns and use that
            information to build itself is amazing. I see videos on YouTube of
            people who trained AI models to play video games or learn chess to
            the point where they can beat humans. There are AI models that can
            create images and even videos just from text input. Something I
            would love to see is an AI model that can train itself to code a
            project from scratch with just keywords as input.
          </p>

          <p>
            Game development is another passion of mine. Creating games is one
            of many things I love to do. Having an idea for a game and building
            it from scratch is exciting and brings your ideas to reality. While
            there are game engines where you don't need to code, they have their
            limitations. Coding games from scratch removes these limits since
            games are fundamentally made from code. I believe combining coding
            with a game engine creates a powerful toolset - the engine provides
            a foundation to build from, while coding allows you to extend and
            customize beyond the engine's capabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, I plan to pursue a career in web development/design
            since my skills align most strongly with this field.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm working towards becoming a full-stack developer and continuing
            my coding journey, so this is just the beginning! My coding

            Additionally, I leverage AI models to enhance productivity and
            streamline my workflow, as I believe they represent the future of
            programming (work smarter not harder). I am proactive in researching
            and learning new concepts to tackle challenges effectively and
            deliver results.
