            My name is MarzeeQ Williams and coding is one of my hobbies. My interest in coding started through a game called Minecraft. The game has features that allow you to bring your imagination to life, but the features in the game are limited.

            Learning to code allowed me to make Minecraft mods that give me the most flexibility with what I'm trying to do. Most of my coding interests started with game development and AI, but my career goals are in web development and design. I see game dev and AI as more of a hobby rather than a career, and my strengths lie more with HTML, CSS and JavaScript which is perfect for web development.

            AI fascinates me because of its capabilities. Although I don't fully understand how it works, the little research I did got me hooked. Just the idea of a program that can detect patterns and use that information to build itself is amazing. I see videos on YouTube of people who trained AI models to play video games or learn chess to the point where they can beat humans. There are AI models that can create images and even videos just from text input. Something I would love to see is an AI model that can train itself to code a project from scratch with just keywords as input.

            Game development is another passion of mine. Creating games is one of many things I love to do. Having an idea for a game and building it from scratch is exciting and brings your ideas to reality. While there are game engines where you don't need to code, they have their limitations. Coding games from scratch removes these limits since games are fundamentally made from code. I believe combining coding with a game engine creates a powerful toolset - the engine provides a foundation to build from, while coding allows you to extend and customize beyond the engine's capabilities.

            Ultimately, I plan to pursue a career in web development/design since my skills align most strongly with this field. Python, SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Flask are the only backend technologies I know, and I'm still a beginner with them.

            I'm working towards becoming a full-stack developer and continuing my coding journey, so this is just the beginning! My coding adventure started{" "}

            Additionally, I leverage AI copilots to enhance productivity and streamline my workflow, as I believe they represent the future of programming (work smarter not harder). I am proactive in researching and learning new concepts to tackle challenges effectively and deliver results.
